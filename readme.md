### mermaid graphs

Mermaid is a simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via javascript. It is a great way to add flowcharts, sequence diagrams, gantt charts, and more to your ReadMe file.

Here is an example chart showing role of a readme file in a project:

```mermaid
